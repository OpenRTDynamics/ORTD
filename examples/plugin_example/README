Plugin example
--------------

Make sure ORTD was build with target.conf containing "LINUX" (standard), which enables the
use of shared libraries (*.so files)

1) Run ./build.sh to compile the C-Code within plugin.c (chmod +x build.sh to make it executable)
2) Run the demo_controller.sce Scilab Script 
   (produces *.[ir]par files; not needed unless you changed something inside)
3) ./run.sh (chmod +x run.sh to make it executable)
