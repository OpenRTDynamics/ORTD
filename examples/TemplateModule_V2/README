This is a template that can be either used for an ORTD-module
or to compile computational functions into an ORTD-plugin
that can be loaded during simulation startup.

The important files are:

  scilab_loader.sce: Interfacing function for Scilab 
  Template_blocks.cpp: The computational functions written in C/C++
  demo/demo.sce: An example on how to use the block

To use it as a module copy or link this folder to the modules/
directory of the framework and recompile the framework
using 

  make clean
  make
  make install
  make scilabhelp .

To produce a plugin run

  make plugin

within this folder. The result will the the shared library
ortd_plugin.so, which must then be placed into the directory
from where you are going to run you simulation from via
the "libdyn_generic_exec"-command.
