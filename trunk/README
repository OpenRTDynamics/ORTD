OpenRTDynamics v1.00-svn -- Open Real-Time Dynamics - A framework
                            for implementing real-time controllers
                            and signal processing algorithms.

                            (openrtdynamics.sf.net)

Version of this document: 24.10.2013

The Real-Time Dynamics Framework is a novel approach to the implementation
of block- / signal-based schematics, commonly used in control engineering 
and signal processing, for real-time usage (like Real-Time WorkshopÂ® or 
Scicos Code Generation). This framework is suitable for time discrete signal 
processing algorithms, using the same principles like in Scicos/Xcos or 
Simulink. However, schematics are described by combining special Scilab 
functions provided by the framework.

In contrast to Xcos or Simulink, the framework does not require source 
code generation / compilation steps to create rt-programs and therefore 
does not rely on C-compilers for the target system that had to be installed 
on the development computer. Instead an efficient to online-interprete 
binary representation is assembled by the framework-provided Scilab functions
and executed by the libortd real-time interpreter.

Due to the description using Scilab, well structured code can be achieved, 
whereby i.e. a filter design could be placed nearby the implementation 
for a better human-readability. Additionally, functional and object orientated 
design schemes can be realised. The latter feature enables the possibility to 
implement reusable parametrised sub-schematics that may also change in its 
structure based on parameters.

Further, along with the remote control interface and the ability to 
implement state machines, to run different simulations in threads (e.g. 
to distribute calculations across multiple CPUs) and to include Scilab-Code 
as computational functions (S-function like), ORTD is also ideally suited 
for laboratory automation. The ability to replace sub-schematics with new 
implementations and parameters during runtime removes the effort of 
restarting the main real-time program. Simulations running in threads can 
also be synchronised to sensor updates or other events e.g. variable timers. 

Please Note: OpenRTDynamics does not depend on any part of Scicos/Xcos.
             ORTD uses algorithms for time-deterministic interpretation of 
             simulations.
             Only the Scilab Scripting language is required for describing
             the schematics and only during development. During runtime, no
             more than standard C/C++ libraries are required, therefore
             ORTD is very uncomplicated to install and maintain, even on
             other platforms. The need for difficult and cryptic instructions 
             for the installation of this framework was intentionally avoided.
             

The ORTD runtime library can be easily integrated into other simulation 
frameworks e.g. Scicos or used within other software by including a shared 
library.


--- The features that make this framework powerful ---

* Nesting simulations (sub-controllers) into each other up to unlimited depth,
  using state machines (each state is represented by a simulation that is
  reset when the state is left), or asynchronously running (threaded) sub-
  simulations. Sub-simulations are included by special blocks that
  implement a framework for state machines or threads and take functions 
  describing the sub-simulations as their arguments along with their I/O 
  ports. (modules/nested)

* Ability to synchronise threaded sub-simulations to external event sources,
  e.g. timers (modules/synchronisation), incoming network packages or 
  sensor readings...

* Online replacement of sub-controllers; Yes, can can exchange wires and blocks
  during the controller is running (modules/nested)

* Communication with Scilab from the simulations (modules/scilab),
  e.g. for running calibration scripts on previously recorded data

--- Other nice features ---

* Mathematical formula parsing (modules/muparser)
* Remote control interface (modules/rt_server)
* Starting external processes (modules/ext_process)
* Ability to call time-discrete Xcos-Blocks trough a wrapper (modules/scicos_blocks), 
  e.g. those from the HART toolbox. If you're interested, please ask me how to do so,
  as I didn't publish some code that would automate this by now.
* Networking: raw UDP send- and receive functionality
* ...

PART  I  --  TECHNICAL INFORMATION



                         
OS DEPENDENCY
-------------

- Runs on Linux. 
- Also compiles & runs on the armv7l / Linux platform (Beaglebone, Rasperry PI and 
                                                                        many others)
- And probably other UNIX-like OS but never tried

On Linux one of the rare APIs that stayed (almost) compatible for more than several
year are the ones of libc, pthreads, and the standard C++ - libraries :-) and :-(, as 
there could be more constant APIs. Since OpenRTDynamics is supposed to also stay 
functional in the long term future, this framework is *only* depending these very 
fundamental libraries. However, the functionally can be enhanced by additional libraries 
that are automatically detected and used.

Because of these relaxed dependencies, it should not be a big issue to port
this framework to other (real-time) OSs.

LICENSE
-------

LGPL, see COPYING / COPYING.LESSER

REQUIREMENTS
------------

On the development host:
 * Linux (Ubuntu is tested)
 * Scilab 5.3. or above. It will be automatically installed via the graphical installer.

On the executing / real-time target (can also be the development host):
 * Linux (Ubuntu is tested, rt_preemption is supported but not required)
 * Nothing more than standard libraries (libc, libpthreads, C++ standard libs, ...)
 * Optional: An installation of Scilab, libblas, libgsl

For compiling the framework
 * Standard tools like: bash, gcc, g++, make, perl

 Optional libraries
 * libgsl, libblas (If their corresponding development packages are installed, some
   additional functionality is gained. They are automatically detected when running
   make config)

INSTALLATION (GRAPHICAL INSTALLATION)
-------------------------------------

The newest version is found in subversion and can be installed by a graphical 
user interface via pasting

  sudo apt-get install g++ make subversion

and 

  wget openrtdynamics.sf.net/getit.sh -O - | bash

into your Terminal on Linux. You should also install Scilab if you're
asked to do so as the ORTD toolbox for Scilab will be automatically
installed.

COMPILATION / INSTALLATION (normal PC x86/amd64)
------------------------------------------------

The suggested way is to use the automatic installation routine as described on their
website. However, if you intent to do the compilation / installation by hand you can go 
on with the following procedure:

- Configure your target system through target.conf (not needed for normal installations).
- Run "make config" and then "make" followed by "make install" on x32/x64/ARM-Linux platforms.

This will compile libortd.so and bin/ortd the generic 
schematic interpreter. Both files are copied to /usr/local/[bin,lib] respectively.


The command

  $ make install_toolbox

will ask you for your Scilab 5 installation directory (where the package from the
Scilab Website was extracted) and installs the Scilab toolbox.

The manual way woulf be to link the "ld_toolbox" directory (not only its contents) 
to your <scilab installation directory>/share/scilab/contrib .

Use

  $ make scilabhelp

to generate help files for the Scilab help. (Try e.g. "help ld_gain" in Scilab to test it)

Cleaning up is done via

  $ make clean

This should be executed when compiling and updated version from subversion.


IMPORTANT MAKE-TARGETS
----------------------

make config          # Configure the framework, e.g. check for libraries
make                 # Compile
make install         # Install to /usr/local/[lib,bin]
make homeinstall     # Install the ortd binary into the home directory ( ~/bin )
make demo            # run a demo
make package         # Create a self extracting and self compiling copy of the framework 
                       contained within a shell archieve OpenRTDynamics_source.sh
                       which can be transfered to target platforms e.g. ARM-targets
                       like the Beaglebone, Rasperry Pi, ...
                       The archieve requires a build system on the target system.

make scilabhelp      # Update the help of the Scilab Toolbox
make install_toolbox # Run the installer for the Scilab Toolbox
make clean           # Clean up, always use this after updating the framework e.g. via svn
make cleanBuildFiles # remove all files generated during the build process, but not the
                       resulting binaries
make clearconfig     # Delete the information gathered during make config.

BUILDING A SELF-EXTRACTING AND COMPILING PACKAGE
------------------------------------------------

To build a self extracting and self compiling archieve run:

  $ bash <ORTDFolder>/AutoBuild/LINUX_source/build.sh this <openrtdynamics-source> <OpenRTDynamics_source>

from outside of the openrtdynamics-source directory or alternatively

  $ make package

from within the source tree.

This gives a file called <OpenRTDynamics_source>.sh which inclues a copy of the cleaned up folder 
<openrtdynamics-source>. This can then be transfered to target systems, where the 
sources are compiled automatically. Of course a build system is required on the target system.

UPDATING THE SUBVERSION VERSION
-------------------------------

Use 

  svn up;  make clean; make; make install; make scilabhelp

to get a correct update.


INSTALLATION ON BEAGLEBONE (and likely other Boards that support Ubuntu for ARM)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Install Ubuntu 12.04 (The ÃngstrÃ¶m-Linux should also work, 
                         but I guess there no package for Scilab, 
                         which is optional though)
2) sudo apt-get update
3) sudo apt-get install subversion g++ make
3b) sudo apt-get install scilab  # optional
4) cd
5) svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/openrtdynamics/code/trunk OpenRTDynamics   # get latest version from subversion
6) cd OpenRTDynamics
7) make clean; make; make install    # Compiles ORTD from source

Internet access is required for this procedure. Alternatively you can download the
the current svn-folder from

  http://sourceforge.net/p/openrtdynamics/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/ (Download snapshot)

and transfer it to the BB. Unpacking and proceeding with step 6) shall do the same.

In order to develop schematics ,you can prepare them on your PC using Scilab and the 
installed Toolbox and upload the *.[i,r]par files to your Beaglebone, where they get 
executed. For this it is suggested to use some file transfer protocol like SFTP to 
upload files. You can install the ssh-server on your Beaglebone using

$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server .

Then you can connect via Gnome "Connect to server" or whatever you like. For directly 
storing your whole project on the Beaglebone Filesystem you can also investigate 
the "~/.gvfs" folder and use it to edit / execute Scilab files directly on your PC, 
whereby the files are stored on your Beaglebone. By this you would not copy the 
irpar-files by hand every time. You also need an installation of ORTD on your host
for development using Scilab (see above).

An example for accessing the BB hardware, is available in examples/beaglebone. 
To run it, do on the BB:

$ sh build.sh
$ sudo sh run.sh

The LED should now blink randomly.



INCLUDING YOUR HARDWARE VIA PLUGINS OR MODULES
----------------------------------------------

Hardware can be added via new blocks by the plugin interface or by adding your own 
module in the modules/ folder or by plugins (shared libraries). 

See also section -- DEVELOPING MODULES & BLOCKS -- for an example.

Old information:
  For an example on plugins, please have a look at examples/plugin_example. For using
  plugins you need have the Target "Linux" enabled (see TARGET CONFIGURATION above).


TARGET CONFIGURATION (to adjust the target system for the interpreter)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The following targets can be choosen in target.conf:

1) RTAI_COMPATIBLE (runs within RTAI; Plugins are disabled because shared libraries
                    are not supported in RTAI, NOTE: This has not been tested for a long time)
2) LINUX (Default, includes support for RT-Preemption if available)
2a) LINUX_DEBUG   (Like LINUX but debugger information is included)
3) CYGWIN (not functional up to now, to run ORTD-simulations on Windows)
4) ANDROID_ARM (Android using Android NDK cross compile toolchain, see the android section in
                this document)
5) ANDROID_ARM_NEON (Like above but with NEON-support for newer arm devices)
6) LINUX_x86_32 Generates a 32Bit-build of openrtdynamics on an x86_64 Linux operating system.
                On Ubuntu installing "gcc-multilib", "ia32-libs" and "g++-multilib" is required.
7) XCOS_RTAI_COMPATIBLE For including ORTD into Scicos/Xcos. Possibly including RTAI-Code generation.
       
                
                
ANDROID (ANDROID_ARM-target)
----------------------------

   Requires the executables from the NDK (http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html):

     arm-linux-androideabi-gcc,    arm-linux-androideabi-c++,   arm-linux-androideabi-g++
   
   Therefore, let the NDK create a toolchain for you and set the environment variables
   (as described in docs/STANDALONE-TOOLCHAIN.HTML of the NDK's documentation folder) 

     export PATH=<Path to AndroidArmToolchain>/bin/:$PATH

   currently there is only the ortd & ortd_static executable available,
   which can be run from e.g. an android terminal application. (No nice App for now)

   NOTE: at the moment, before compiling through "make" you need to remove the EDF-module
         as it does not compile for android:   rm -rf modules/EDF


   PRECOMPILED BINARIES
   --------------------

   A recently updated and compiled version is available from:

     http://openrtdynamics.sf.net/download/Android/current/OpenRTDynamics_android.tgz
 
   Only the static executable can be obtained from:

    http://openrtdynamics.sf.net/download/Android/current/ortd_static.gz

   You can run the binary using an android terminal emulator like e.g.
   terminalIDE if you copy the executable "ortd_static" to a folder "bin"
   in the home directory. Also create the links

     ln -s ortd_static ortd
     ln -s ortd_static libdyn_generic_exec


   Using with App TerminalIDE
   --------------------------

   NOTE: The following is a work in progress and does not work
         for now, because hostnames are not resolved.

   When you use the Terminal-App "terminalIDE" you can copy and paste the
   following lines to install the pre-compiled framework:


## Just install the executable
cd
mkdir bin
cd bin
rm -f ortd_static ortd 
rm -f libdyn_generic_exec_static 
rm -f libdyn_generic_exec

wget http://openrtdynamics.sf.net/download/Android/current/ortd_static.gz
gzip -d ortd_static.gz
chmod +x ortd_static

ln -s ortd_static ortd
ln -s ortd_static libdyn_generic_exec
ln -s ortd_static libdyn_generic_exec_static


## Install the whole compiled framework including the examples
cd
wget http://openrtdynamics.sf.net/download/Android/current/OpenRTDynamics_android.tgz
tar xfvz OpenRTDynamics_android.tgz
rm OpenRTDynamics_android.tgz

#
# OR simpler
#
wget http://openrtdynamics.sf.net/getitAndroid.sh -O - | bash


CALLING SCILAB FROM ORTD SIMULATIONS
------------------------------------

With help of the module "scilab" (modules/scilab) blocks can be implemented
using the scilab language (example available in (modules/scilab/demo).
For this, Scilab is started as a separate process and interfaced by
standard input / output streams.

A built-in path for the Scilab executable is chosen during compilation
of the library (i.e. make) as follows:

1) The scilab executable from the Scilab installation that comes along the graphical
   installation of ORTD is used (configured in the file scilabdir.conf).

2) If there is a command "scilab" in the system this one is used if 1)
   was not successful.

3) No built-in path for the Scilab binary is included. However, the binary
   can be specified in the block "ld_scilab*" that includes the Scilab code.

HART-Module INSTALLATION
------------------------

Please Note: The hart modules hasn't been tested for a long time
             and only Scilab 4.1.2 was supported. For newer Scilab
             versions the module has to be adapted a bit. 
             UPDATE: It is now working again -- still only for Scilab 4.1.2

Compile & install the framework using the target "XCOS_RTAI_COMPATIBLE":

  echo "XCOS_RTAI_COMPATIBLE" > target.conf
  make clean; make; make install

Link hart/hart_ortd to the modules/ directory of your HART-Toolbox. 

  ln -s hart/hart_ortd <hart-dir>/modules

WARNING: Do not make a copy -- otherwise some header files are not found
         during compilation.

TOOLS
-----

- ortd: (the new name of libdyn_generic_exec)
    executes schematics in real-time (rt_preempt) OR as fast as possible
    Schematics are getting some dummy in and outputs, but should not be
    used.

    type "ortd --help" for help

- ortd_static: The statically linked version of the executable
               (can be used without installing libraries into 
                the system, runs nearly everywhere)

LIST OF PROVIDED BLOCKS
-----------------------

Have a look at documentation/List_of_Module_Blocks.txt.
It is an automatically generated list of available blocks.

In Scilab try "help ld_gain" to get into the help folders for ORTD.

MODULES
-------

Modules are placed within the modules subdirectory. For now, you will find the
following:

- muparser: Evaluation of mathematical expressions
- rt_server: Remote control of your controller via an TCP-Interface (Experimental)
- nested: includind and switching of ORTD-Simulations within ORTD-Simulations (Experimental)
- basic_ldblocks: Basic Blocks (hysteresis, modulo counter, (de)multiplexer, 2to1 switch ...)
- template: A module template for creating your own blocks
- ...
- ... (Need to update this list)


DEVELOPING MODULES & BLOCKS
---------------------------

There is a template in examples/TemplateModule_V2.
An older version is found in modules/template".
For very basic block functionality you can also refer to modules/basic_ldblocks

IMPORTANT: Since there is no guarantee for a stable ABI (Application binary interface)
           you should *re-compile* any ORTD-plugin after updating ORTD. The API
           (defined by the ORTD-header files) however is going to stay compatible,
           so you do not have to change you source code for each new version of ORTD,
           which probably makes your life easier :-)

ADDITIONAL THINGS
-----------------

Within additional/joystick, there is a separate Python-Script to read out a connected
joystick and feed the data directly to ORTD-schematics via the rt_server infrastructure.
It can be used for an example to easily integrate other input devices. Only one simple 
Python-Script is needed for that.

PRINCIPLES FOR DEVELOPING SCHEMATICS
------------------------------------

Each block is represented by a call to a scilab function that includes a block
or a set of blocks into a simulation:

  [sim, u] = ld_play_simple(sim, ev, r=[1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1] );
  [sim, y] = ld_gain(sim, ev, u, 1.5);

The description of the simulation is stored within the structure "sim". The variables
"u" and "y" represent in- and output signals that are used to connect blocks. The prefix 
"ld_" denotes "lib dynamic", which is the name of the interpreter. The parameter "ev" 
is due to a design decision in the past that was then never used. It must be set to zero 
(ev=0) at the moment. In a next major revision this is likely that there will be new 
block interfaces where this will be removed. In this simple example, during each 
simulation time step k, the current value u[k]=r[k] is multiplied by 1.5 yielding 
y[k] = 1.5 * r[k].

It is important to note, that not the scilab commands are executed during runtime. They
are only used to describe the blocks and their connections. Functions with the ld_-prefix
are typically defined in the scilab_loader.sce files.

  --- Blocks that synchronise simulations ---

There are some special blocks that trigger a simulation step of the simulation containing
such a block. They are used to execute a simulation step when a certain event occurs, e.g.
a network packet arrives or a certain amount of time has passed. Some of these blocks are:

  * ld_ClockSync  // Sync to a timer
  * ld_AndroidSensors   // When a measurement becomes available
                           one simulation step is performed
  * ld_UDPSocket_Recv  // One simulation when a network packet arrives
  * ld_RecvNotifications  // Receives notifications triigered by other simulations
                             running in other threads


Such blocks must be placed into simulations that are running in threads started by 
"ld_async_simulation".

Examples are e.g. given in

modules/synchronisation/demo/timed_thread_v2.sce
modules/udp_communication/demo/udp_receiver.sce

An template of the C++ - source code for such a block is given in 

examples/TemplateModule_V2/Template_blocks.cpp, class SynchronisingTemplateBlock



  --- Threads ---

Threads are initiated by

        ThreadPrioStruct.prio1=ORTD.ORTD_RT_NORMALTASK; // or  ORTD.ORTD_RT_NORMALTASK
        ThreadPrioStruct.prio2=0; // for ORTD.ORTD_RT_REALTIMETASK: 1-99 as described in   man sched_setscheduler
        ThreadPrioStruct.cpu = 1; // -1 means dynamically assign CPU

        [sim, startcalc] = ld_initimpuls(sim, 0); // triggers your computation only once

        [sim, outlist, computation_finished] = ld_async_simulation(sim, 0, ...
                              inlist=list(), ...
                              insizes=[], outsizes=[], ...
                              intypes=[], outtypes=[], ...
                              nested_fn = Threadfn, ...
                              TriggerSignal=startcalc, name="VisThread", ...
                              ThreadPrioStruct, userdata=list() );

hereby the time-scheduling parameters like the thread's priority or CPU affinity can be 
configured. The ORTD-Superblock

	function [sim, outlist, userdata] = Threadfn(sim, inlist, userdata)
	  // This sub-simulation will run in a thread
          // wait for event
          [sim, signal ] = ld_RecvNotifications(sim, 0, ObjectIdentifyer="signal");
          [sim, signal___] = ld_Int32ToFloat(sim, ev, signal ); // signal must be catched, otherwise ld_RecvNotifications will be optimised out

	  [sim, R] = ld_read_global_memory(sim, ev, index=readI, ident_str="RotMat", datatype=ORTD.DATATYPE_FLOAT, ElementsToRead=9);
          [sim] = ld_printf(sim, ev, R,   "R = ", 9);

	  // output of schematic
	  outlist = list();
	endfunction

will then run in thread and the simulation is synchronised using ld_RecvNotifications to the
occurrences of events sent to this thread (c.f. section "Blocks that synchronise simulations").

EXAMPLES
--------

Type "make demo" in the main folder.

Examples can be found within the "examples" subdirectory.

FIXME: Update this

For a ready to run example go into the examples directory via shell and type:

$ sh sh_runoscillator

A second try could be to execute "simple_demo.sce" within scilab 5 or above. 
It will create *.[i,r]par files containing the schematic.
Ensure that you loaded the "ld_toolbox" at first. Then run the command 

$ libdyn_generic_exec -s simple_demo -i 901 -l 100

within the "examples" directory. It will load the [i,r]par files, 
compile the schematic and start execution. This example will create
several â.datâ output files.

You can also use simple_demo.sce as a template.

Another example is pulsetest -- a realtime synthesiser, which uses pulseaudio.
Therefore, for compiling you need to install the pa-headers at first:

sudo apt-get install libpulse-dev

Run it with ./pulsetest and type âqâ or âwâ or âESCâ.

DATATYPES
---------

  - ORTD.DATATYPE_FLOAT (Scilab), DATATYPE_FLOAT (C) is "double"
  - ORTD.DATATYPE_INT32 (Scilab), DATATYPE_INT32 (C) is "int32_t"
  - ORTD.DATATYPE_BINARY (Scilab), DATATYPE_BINARY (C) is "char" (8 Bit)

  - more to come ...

Nevertheless the majority of the available blocks *only* support
DATATYPE_FLOAT by now. Especially the ld_statemachine block
does not support datatypes other than DATATYPE_FLOAT.
A block ld_statemachine2 is about to come...

For data conversion the following blocks are available up to now:

Simple datatypes: ld_roundInt32, ld_ceilInt32, ld_floorInt32, ld_Int32ToFloat
Structures: ld_DisassembleData, ld_ConcateData

IMPORTANT SOURCE FILES
----------------------

- modules/basic_ldblocks/[basic_ldblocks.c,basicCppBlocks.cpp]:
               Most blocks for basic functionality. Could be also
               be used as templates / examples for block computational
               functions.

- modules/basic_ldblocks/scilab_loader.sce
               Interfacing functions for most blocks for basic 
               functionality. Could be also be used as templates /
               examples for block computational functions.

- irpar.[c,h]: A small and efficient implementation for storing
               vectors of data, strings or other objects within
               a vector of "double" and another containing "int"
               values.

- libdyn.[c,h]: The core simulator implementation, which reads the
                list of block interconnections, sets up all blocks,
                determines the order of execution and executes
                simulation steps.

- libdyn_cpp.[cpp,h]: C++ wrapper for libdyn.c

- irpar.sci: Scilab interface for irpar.c for encoding data structures
             that can be read by irpar.c

- libdyn.sci: Scilab interface for creating and connecting blocks. The
              resulting schematic is stored within irpar.c data structures.

- libdyn_generic_exec.cpp: Source code for the command "ortd", which
                           runs schematics.

REAL-TIME BENCHMARK
-------------------

A benchmark to evaluate the real-time capabilities is available in

modules/synchronisation/demo/TestRealTime.sce

You could also consider this as an example on how to start multiple 
threads with different priorities and CPU assignments.


        

PART  II  --  BACKGROUND INFORMATION




MOTIVATION FOR ANOTHER REAL-TIME FRAMEWORK
------------------------------------------

Since I'm working in the field of biomedical control engineering, my expectations on 
the reliability & flexibility of the software controlling something that is acting on 
the human body are very high. 

When doing experiments, in clinical environments only limited time is available. Faults 
in the operation are critical up to some high extend and technical inadequacies like 
instable software that requires several attempts to fully run can simply not be accepted.
It shall be possible to re-calibrate and make individual adaptations to the implementation
in the shortest time possible. Therefore, instead of code generation, this framework 
uses an interpreter (the Scilab description is assembled faster than generating and 
compiling C-Code). Additionally, new sub-implementations can be designed and loaded 
on-line while e.g. the data acquisition devices stay up and running.

Also I don't like complicated installation procedures where one has to edit files,
adapt directory paths and install numerous other libraries from their sources by hand.
ORTD compiles and installs itself automatically from its source files on the individual
target system. If there is a library installed that could enable additional functionality 
for ORTD, it is used. If not installed, ORTD doesn't complain.

If you find a bug in the software or things that you just do not find so nice,
it would be very cool if give me a short notice/comment by Email. Even complaints like 
"I have to type so much commands when doing ..." are TOTALLY welcome. Every time the user 
of this framework is subjected to an higher programing effort than theoretically necessary, 
something could be improved! Thus let me know. ORTD is supposed be as smart and relaxed 
as possible.




APPENDIX  --  GOOD TO KNOW


CONTRIBUTIONS
-------------

Contributions to this framework are gracefully welcome! Thus if you introduced support
for some kind of hardware e.g. GPIO-interfaces from embedded system or missing blocks
for the basic functionality, do not hesitate.


TODO
----

- Better Documentation :-) (DONE but can always be improved, of course):

- Wrapper block for background computations for state updates (DONE)
- nested schematics (DONE)
- exchangeable schematics (DONE)
- tcp server for remote control, parameter uploading ... (DONE)
- block interpreting math formula (DONE; with help of muParser)
- wrapper for Scicos blocks and inclusion of hart toolbox; DONE
- a dynamical linker that loads *so files as it might be described
  within the schematics
- A matrix module (multiplication, inversion ...); partially DONE
- A Kalman Filter build with basic blocks
- ....

BUGS
----

- Transfer function blocks are limited by a order of max 20 for the given tf
  No error catching
- Objects created by libdyn_new_feedback can ONLY be used once.
- The IO-Performance of the rt_server module is suboptimal.
  Needs a better implementation of buffered io.
- If an ld_stream block is not connected with another block
  the initialisation of the parameter is not done (but its actually not needed in this case)

- module udp_communication: If the host name is not known a segfault may be triggered (FIXED)

- All blocks that synchronise simulations
  If a block without inputs has outputs and they are not connected the block will be optimised output.
  However, if it is supposed to synchronise a simulation this not possible then. So please: Connect
  the outputs otherwise there will be surprising results.

- Check if ld_async_simulation waits for the termination of the nested simulation. Intoduce a sleep(10) 
  and see what happening

- Check what is happening if there is actually no block in a simulation.

- It works stable (Used for many controller implementations in medical
  control at TU-Berlin)

CHANGELOG
---------

11.4.11 (v0.99b)
  - small Bug within ld_const function
  - a new printf block

v0.99c
  - Makefile
  - better dokumentation

v0.99d
  - Nicer Scilab interface

v0.99e
  - Modules support
  - muParser (http://muparser.sourceforge.net/) Block supporting math formula within simulations
    there is an example within examples/muparser.sce
  - HART-module (hart.sf.net) for using ORTD in Scicos simulations
  - remote control interface via TCP to set parameters via a new "ld_parameter" block
    enable it in libdyn_generic_exec by the --master_tcpport <port> option
    an example can be found under examples/remote_control.sce
  - Scicos block for integration of ortd schematics

v0.99f
  - sync and async nested ortd simulations (Module nested, experimental)
  - going on with rt_server
  - Joystick integration via a small Python-Script and the rt_server module

By date as there will only be the svn-version

  - 9.12.12: Pipeline-module added coming with a ring-buffer implementation for communication between threads  
  - 28.3.13: Android Target available
  - 10.5.13: Added ld_file_save_machine2 macro, that allows to automatically detect port sizes and types
             It is also a nice example on using state machines
  - 10.5.13: Improvement of the simulation synchronisation infrastructure
  - 14.5.13: Improved the definition of blocks and created a new template for a ORTD-module
             in examples/TemplateModule_V2.
  - 14.5.13: Added write support for EDF+ (European Data Format) - files
  - 28.5.13: Easier implementation of objects that can be shared between blocks
  -  3.6.13: A new module for UDP-Communication
  - 20.7.13: * Fixed a bug in synchronisation module that prevented destroying simulations on
             exit. Also the code was rewritten and looks now nicer. Now use
             ld_ClockSync instead of ld_synctimer which was experimental and is now obsolete.
  -          * Added ld_async_simulation for running simulations in thread. This replaces
             the old scheme where ld_nested2 was used.
  -          * Cleaned up class libdyn_nested2 in libdyn_cpp.cpp
  - 17.8.13: More datatypes and blocks for datatype conversion; UDP send/receive blocks (EXPERIMENTAL).
  - 28.8.13: The individual CPU and the priority to run a thread can be adjusted with ld_async_simulation.
  - 2.9.13:  Blocks that allow to notify (send events) to threads and corresponding blocks for receiving
             these events. Seems to work -- however an example is missing.
