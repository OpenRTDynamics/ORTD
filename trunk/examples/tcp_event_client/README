README - tcp_event_client
reads lines from a tcp-server and processes them
the data is interpreted to read scopes, infos of them and the data which they send
the client uses the qt-event-routines, so it is possible to easily update widgets on the screen
this example updates an progress bar with the data of the scope "osc_output", therefor the function
"test_function" of the qt_event_communication-class is used.
For updating other widgets the function "handle_data" of the same class has to be changed.

Using this example:
a) Build the example with:
	1) qmake-qt4
	2) make
b) run the remote-example:
	1) cd openrtdynamics/trunk/examples/
	2) sh remote.sh
c) run the program
	-it shows a window with a progress bar which oscillates
