Example to the communication interface
--------------------------------------

Prerequirement: Needs openrtdynamics.sf.net including the hart module to be installed. 

0) start scilab out of this directory
1) run the cos file "hand_communication.cos". The files "interface_hand.?par" need
   to be available.
2) open a shell and connect to the TCP-Interface (the TCP-Port is 10002):

 netcat localhost 10002
 
3) Type "ls" to, which streams and scopes are available
4) Type "set_param  control_signal # 1 # 2.3 # 0 # 0 # 0  # 0 # 0 # 0 # 0 # 0" and
   see in the scicos scope how parameters change.
5) Type "stream_fetch output 0" and you will get a stream of the data
   going into the generic_libdyn block.
6) Hit Cntrl-C to disconnect


In order to change the number of input / output ports edit and execute 
interface_hand.sce. Additionally the block mask of the
"generic_libdyn"-Scicosblock needs to be changed.
