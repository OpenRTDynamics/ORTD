Short introduction on using the demo for online replaceable schematics
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Compile the gui (needs qt-dev and qwtplotlib included in /thirdparty)

cd gui
qmake-qt4
make

Run the main schematic:

  sh Run.sh

Then you can start the gui, contained in the subfolder "gui" using 

  gui/gui_interface 

The file main.sce contains the main schematic, which includes a
nested one. The file create_replacement.sce is used to generate 
a schematic / controller, which replaces the current one contained 
in main.sce at runtime.
