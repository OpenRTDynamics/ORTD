-------------------------------------------------------------------
      This is a module / plugin to the Real-time framework
                     OpenRTDynamics.sf.net
-------------------------------------------------------------------


This is a template that can be either used for an ORTD-module
or to compile computational functions into an ORTD-plugin
that can be loaded during simulation startup.

The important files are:

  scilab_loader_Prototype.sce: Interfacing function for Scilab 
  TemplateModule_V2_blocks.cpp: The computational functions written in C/C++
  demo/demo.sce: An example on how to use the block

Edit the Makefile and edit the module name
(must be the same name like the folder in which the module is placed)
as well as the start for blockids (find a free one from the ORTD-README 
file.  
  
To use it as a module copy or link this folder to the modules/
directory of the framework and recompile the framework
using 

  make clean
  make
  make install
  make scilabhelp . 

To compile a plugin, run

  make plugin

within this folder. The result will be a shared library
ortd_plugin.so, which must then be placed into the directory
from where you are going to run you simulation from via
the "ortd"-command. The system searches for ortd_plugin.so
and ortd_plugin[0-9].so and loads all of them.
