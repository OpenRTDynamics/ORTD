Executes time discrete Scicos/Xcos - blocks

NOTE: The scicos computaional functions have to be linked 
to the executable with which you run your simulation.

Compatibility
-------------

depending on the version of scicos_block4.h this wrapper
is compatible with scilab5 or scilab4 or scicoslab.
Currently only scilab5 (Xcos) is supported.

You can use the additional module include_hart to use
the blocks of the HART-Toolbox (hart.sf.net). For this,
you have to choose a version of scilab5 in the Makefile
of the hart toolbox
